## Jumpcut Thesaurus

- This project uses a previous small project of mine as a scaffold. :)
- I don't like using generators like `yeoman` or `create-react-app` because they're kinda bloated sometimes.


## Getting Started

- Use `yarn serve` to start the Express server. It uses `webpack-dev-middleware`.
